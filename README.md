# Enterprise-ready cloud

Trey Research is a manufacturing company that builds consumer products with 29.6 billion USD in annual revenue. Trey's headquarters are in New Jersey, but they have data centers and branch offices scattered across the United States; with several major offices in the United Kingdom, France, and Japan.

Even as large as it is, Trey seeks to maximize the cost-effectiveness and flexibility of its IT, especially in new projects and business units. With a dizzying number of existing business units; each with their own unique requirements from IT and ballooning costs from internal hardware and data center investment, Trey is looking to the cloud.

Trey is interested in a large-scale solution that will help mitigate creeping costs and start the transition to a modern cloud-based enterprise architecture using a solid set of controls for governance.


## Target audience
- Infrastructure Architect

## Abstract

### Workshop

In this workshop you will create an Azure Cloud Governance plan to advise a manufacturing company of the features available in Azure. You will discover features to bring governance to their Azure deployments, distributed administration, and allowance for secure remote connectivity and development work for their offshore developers. 

At the end of the workshop, you will be better able to design a governance plan to showcase the security and governance features of Azure and control costs. In addition, you'll learn how to provide for cost tracking by business unit, environment, and project, provide for a distributed administration model, put a service catalog in place to prevent deployment of unsupported Azure services, and put controls in place to allow deployment of services only in specific regions. You will also learn how to deploy and manage your Azure subscriptions from a tenant level through Management groups and Azure Blueprints.

### Whiteboard Design Session

In this whiteboard design session, you will work in a group to design a comprehensive solution to address concerns about cost management, security, subscription and resource management, identity, deployment, and other areas to help apply an enterprise governance model for Trey Research.

At the end of this whiteboard design session, you will be better able to design a governance plan to showcase the security, governance, and cost management features of Azure. In addition, you'll learn how to provide cost tracking and alerting by business unit and environment, implement a distributed administration model, and control the deployment of Azure services, all delivered at scale across a large enterprise.

### Hands-on Lab

In this hands-on lab, you are working with Trey Research to setup some best practices regarding policies, permissions, and management of subscription artifacts such as Policy and Azure Resource Manager templates through Azure Blueprints.  Tasks include creating scripts that Enterprise IT will use to automatically set policy and delegate permissions when a new subscription is created. You will help them build a management solution using Azure Blueprints in combination with Management Groups..

At the end of this hands-on lab, you will know how to provide cost tracking by business unit, environment and project with resource tags, provide for a distributed administration model, put a service catalog in place to prevent deployment of unsupported Azure services, and put controls in place to allow deployment of services only in specific regions.
